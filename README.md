This is the Coursera course "Neural Networks for Machine Learning", taught by Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto.
This repository contains all assignments(in original Octave versions) and quizzes, along with links to the corresponding week's videos.
I have also implemented the assignments in Python3 (using Jupyter Notebook) for practise.
